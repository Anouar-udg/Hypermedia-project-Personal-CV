### Information Architecture 
The page is divided into **two main sections** for a clear and structured user experience.  
At the top, the **header** includes the candidate‚Äôs photo, name, job title, and a short professional summary. This gives an immediate overview of who the person is and what they do.  

Below, the **content area** is split into two columns:
- **Left column (blue background):** includes professional information such as internship experience and work history. The dark background differentiates it visually from the personal data on the right, emphasizing the candidate‚Äôs career trajectory.  
- **Right column (light background):** contains education, languages, and contact information ‚Äî elements that complement the main experience section but are secondary in visual hierarchy.  

This distribution allows visitors (like recruiters) to quickly locate key details: professional background on the left and supporting information on the right.  
The structure follows a logical, top-down flow that mirrors how employers scan resumes: identity ‚Üí experience ‚Üí education ‚Üí contact.

### Visual Design
The visual design uses a **modern and minimalist style** to ensure readability and a professional aesthetic. The **color palette** combines a soft beige (`#f7e1b5`) and a deep navy blue (`#0a4474`), creating contrast between personal and professional sections. The beige tone gives warmth and approachability, while the navy blue adds professionalism and reliability.  

The **Poppins** font was chosen for its clean geometric shapes and readability on screens. Rounded corners, soft shadows, and balanced padding create a sense of depth and structure without overcrowding the layout.  

The **profile photo** at the center adds a personal touch and symmetry to the header. The **typography hierarchy** uses distinct weights and colors to differentiate between headings, subheadings, and body text, improving scannability.  

The **responsive design** adapts the two-column layout into a single column on mobile devices to maintain usability. Every visual decision ‚Äî from color selection to spacing ‚Äî focuses on **clarity, legibility, and professional appeal**, ensuring the CV looks good both when viewed online and when printed or exported as PDF.
